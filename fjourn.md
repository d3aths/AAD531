# Formative Assessment Journal

## Experimentations
class tasks/activities and your own experiments. insert screenshots of dev process and include annotations about your process and thoughts.

I spent a while considering what to do my fansite on. It was a toss up between the Final Fantasy series, or a Cyberpunk themed site - possibly for the CP2077 game, or just a kind of fansite for the genre itself, maybe have some kind of interactivity going on. I delayed it for a bit cause I wanted the URL to be appropriate relative to what the content was. So in the end I went with cyberpunk purely because I have a lot more ideas for what I could do, and creating the appropriate aesthetic would be easier for me than a Final Fantasy based one.

The things I most struggled with in this was getting the layout to sit where I wanted it. I usually kinda cheat and just margins to set things in place on a fullscreen desktop website, but that method catches you out whe you go to make the layout responsive, and things can overlap and just look weird when shorted down to a mobile viewpoint. So I spent a good day at least trying to place everything correctly while making sure it still looked fine without any overlap or unwanted behaviour on a mobile layout as well.

I've also been struggling on content, like how could I make a fansite, what sort of things should go on it. Having major creative block, I went around the web and looked at the official site, and other kinda of fansites, to see the kind of content they have and take ideas for myself.

I love the colour palette of this site as these are some of my favourite colours used in combination with each other. For everything in the site, I took hex codes from the background image.

I've been experimenting a bit with the background, and decided that it would look better blurred. The way the CSS works with that is that the body, html, and bg div height has to be set to 100% or it won't show up properly. This caused issues with the main column divs that were originally on the front page. The entire body would blur itself instead of the background image like I wanted. Upon a lot of review, I figured that since we technically have to create a splash page, I could do that and have just a basic splash when you first arrive on the page, and then the content could be displayed after going into the site properly, and I would remove the scanlines and complicated css that was messing it up after. Hopefully I can still get the background to blur within the site as well.

## Formative Professional Pratices 
summarise an area of professional pratice in approx 300 words, use imagery if appropirate, you must use credible academic references and cite your statements. you are welcome ot give your thoughts, however you must have your statements backed up by credible research

you are free to select any area of professional pratice you would like to investigate further, it can include what i have shown you in our professional practice lesson or somethin additional you have an interest in
note: this is a draft for your fromative assessment, you will submit a final copy in your summative assessment

## Inspiration
share 3-4 exmaples of websites etc that have inspire you and briefly write what it is about them that inspires you. how have they been produced. think about functionality, accessibility, how they look on diff devices, dont, imagery, colours, etc

- codepen

https://www.cyberpunk.net/nz/en/

the official website for the CP2077 game. I like the imagery and the frames around them, as well as the way the website flows out when you scroll downwards. The main colours of yellow and blue fits the theme as the game's official colours on all their game boxes, their logos, and in the game itself as interfaces. Thee yellow and blue also fits thematically within the cyberpunk genre itself as it is built on the 80s neon colour aesthetic.

## Development of Splash Page

choosing body font, between

and
![ox](/assets/font-oxanium.png)
browsing fonts for titles and headings is always fun cause you get to find some whack looking stuff.. went with this as it fits the theme really well
![neolat](/assets/font-neolatina.png)

importing those fonts and manually adding neo latina, then grabbed a multi column layout from w3 schools, ive used it a lot in previous work so its handy just having all the code as the template, then you can make whatever changes you want. customizing the headers and buttons and such to have cool effects. i tried messing around with a blurred background but something in the css was mucking it up and as soon as i put it in, the background would disappear entirely. because it had to be its own div, but when you have all these other divs all doing stuff to the page.. i tried to isolate the problem for about 20 minutes before giving up, couldn't figure it out, but it wasn't too much of a problem.. more something i just wanted to see if it looked good or not. having the background less busy. alternatively i can fill up the columns with content and have the opacent which is what im going with at the moment, so the background will be less prevalent. overall loving the colours so far.
