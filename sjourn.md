## Development
I did not play around with any of the class activities after doing one of the lessons and it instructed me to just have this hideous looking solid coloured page that glared at you, showing the resizing. After that I worked on my own developmentations. I didn't waste time with a wireframe as a portfolio is basically just a 1 page wonder that doesn't beget complex design and sitemaps and i've seen enough to know the basic layout that they should follow.
So what I started was with research and looking for inspiration. I like to use codepen for inspiration and search for key words there as it's often hard to find a wide range of live websites that suit your needs like I had no idea what to look for on google to find enough portfolios to get my own creativity working.

### Inspiration
A lot of the designs I saw used minimalism combined with a nice looking colour scheme and played on bold background images as the main points of the site. Well at least those are what drew my attention the most. The skills of the designer can be reflected in how the sections of their portfolio transition and flow. A lot of them all seemed one and the same but I suppose when it gets down to it, there is altogether too much that you can do in such a space.
I'll share a few links and what I liked about them.

I love hex shapes in images and things like this, and used a similar pattern for an image gallery in a Twitch.tv redesign I did last year. It would be really cool to use something like this for a menu however it makes having a topnav a bit redundant and I like the idea of a topnav too much, and this is a bit to big for me to include in mine.

This is a super professional looking page, although I wouldn't have the animated shapes on the background like that, but it does show his CSS skills to be able to create them. I liked the way the text changed colour in the same block, and have used that idea on my own page. The page is simple, I think the 2nd section says overview and gives a little info about him and then follows down with some links to outside work then a contact form. Its all that a portfolio needs really.

I liked this portfolio a lottttt. The animation on the page is fantastic and just works so well on the page. The slider that goes down each time you scroll through a section, the animated text and animated sections that fill out as you scroll.  Just superb. The skill bars was something I used on one of the first experiments that I did, but mine were just static and not fancy animations like this. The image gallery of projects he'd created was so clean. I would have liked to have something like that too but just didn't have the time to spin everything I have made back up and get it in such a polished state like that to put on my page.

Last one here, I liked the colours of this porttfolio a lot and have decided to go with a similar colour scheme for my final version. Like the others, it has the basic info that a portfolio needs. No fancy animations but the fonts used and the colours still make it look professional and skilled.

## Experimentation
First I tried out one of the basic white minimalist looking pages, using ideas that I had off some of my inspirations. I did like the way it looked a lot, especially with the little linework under the sections, and how neatly everything fit together, but I felt like it was lacking something, lacking something that has a part of me in it. I guess like, it would be easy if you had a job for a client to create something basic and what they wanted, but personally like a white page without any cool pictures or effects is just so bland. So I remade the site more in line with my style instead of trying to base it on a popular aesthetic that others might like. I downloaded the files before restarting though so I still have it all saved in case I want it.

It looked like this and then there was a small image gallery that I filled with stock photos and a basic contact form at the end, with social media buttons.

In version 2 of my portfolio I was much happier with it as it was more like a reflection of myself in it. I wanted to try out this parallax effect that I had seen a tutorial for and So decided to try it with a random background image from google inside a glowing div to separate some of the sections and just to see how well it went with the website. It is a super cool effect and I think it turned out really nice although if I had more time I could have found an image that made it look super cool like more 3D in some way. I've seen examples of pages that use that effect to scroll down from like the sky to the earth to deep underground, and each like biome is a different section of their page.

## Evaluation and reflection of Final Website
For some reason this was easier than my fansite, I guess because there wasn't any flashy effects and such that I wanted to get right aesthetically. I spent a lot of time working on that kind of thing, but for this site it was a lot more basic, using a standard black red and white. One of my favourite colour combinations. All the images were just stuff I pulled from google, the font was just ol' reliable, Open Sans. For the colours I was also inspired by the Sith colour theme from Star Wars, being a fan of the Old Republic, they use the red black and whites a lot too. You can probably see bits and bits of my influences coming through from the inspiration links I showcased earlier.
I used a lot more div elements in this to set everything in place. Usually I only have a few main ones, but the more I work on front end stuff the more important I see it is to have unique elements for each component, and how to section everything off to improve the positions and overall layout of the page.
The portfolio could have been a bit more substantial if I knew what to write in it. However I am terrible at writing about myself and all that stuff. Every other portfolio I've had to make for classes hasn't had much content at all. If I had more time I could possibly make some kind of gallery with screenshots of previous work but it is a bother to me because I would have to dig through all this old code and figure out what is what, make it live again, and so on.
